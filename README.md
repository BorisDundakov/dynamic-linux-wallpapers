# Dynamic Linux Wallpapers

 ![repo-04](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8cfc9fe-a2c2-4296-80fe-f9a34b596531)

 A script that updates your wallpaper every day with some of the insightful quotes I've gathered throughout the years. 

## How to set up:

1) Copy the folder called `dynamic-wallpapers` inside this repository to your `Documents` folder
2) Execute the following command:
    ```
    crontab -e
    ```
3) Add in your desired time to run the script: Example -> 8 AM every day + at system startup

5) Execute the `dynamic_wallpaper.sh` script inside the repository


You can easily modify the desired time as well as add/remove quotes (text files) inside the `dynamic-wallpapers` folder. Maybe you can even populate it with some quotes of you own!
